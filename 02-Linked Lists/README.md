📚 Linked Lists – Data Structures (Java)
🚀 Overview

This repository contains implementations and explanations of Linked Lists in Java, created as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey.

Linked Lists are dynamic data structures where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers instead of stored in continuous memory like arrays.

This project focuses on understanding the core concepts, operations, and practical implementation of linked lists in a beginner-friendly way.

🧠 What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a collection of nodes where each node contains:

📦 Data – the actual value

🔗 Reference (Pointer) – address of the next node

Unlike arrays:

Size is dynamic

Memory is allocated as needed

Efficient insertion and deletion

📂 Types of Linked Lists Covered
1️⃣ Singly Linked List

Each node points to the next node

Traversal in one direction only

2️⃣ Doubly Linked List

Each node has:

Pointer to next node

Pointer to previous node

Traversal possible in both directions

3️⃣ Circular Linked List

Last node connects back to the first node

No null pointer at the end

⚙️ Operations Implemented

✅ Insertion

Insert at beginning

Insert at end

Insert at position

✅ Deletion

Delete from beginning

Delete from end

Delete specific node

✅ Traversal

Display linked list elements

✅ Searching

Find element in list

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts: Data Structures & Algorithms

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
