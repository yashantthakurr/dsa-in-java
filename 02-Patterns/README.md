# 🔷 Pattern Programs (Java)

This folder contains **pattern-based programs** implemented in Java as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey.

Pattern problems help in developing **logic building**, **loop understanding**, and **problem-solving skills**, which are essential before moving to advanced DSA topics.

## 📖 What I Learned

- Nested loops concept
- Row and column logic
- Understanding pattern structure
- Space and character alignment
- Dry running algorithms step-by-step

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Nested Loops | Using loops inside loops to form patterns |
| Star Patterns | Printing shapes using `*` |
| Number Patterns | Patterns formed using numbers |
| Pyramid Patterns | Center-aligned structures |
| Logic Building | Converting visual patterns into code logic |

---

## 💻 Programs Included

- `SquarePattern.java`
- `RightTrianglePattern.java`
- `InvertedTriangle.java`
- `PyramidPattern.java`
- `NumberPattern.java`

*(More patterns will be added as I continue practicing.)*
