# 📘 Arrays in Java (DSA)

This folder contains my implementations and practice problems related to **Arrays** as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey using Java.

---

## 📖 What I Learned

- What is an Array
- Array declaration and initialization
- Traversing an array
- Searching algorithms
- Basic array operations
- Problem-solving using arrays

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Topic | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Array Basics | Understanding indexing and memory concept |
| Traversal | Iterating using loops |
| Linear Search | Searching element in unsorted array |
| Binary Search | Searching in sorted array |
| Reverse Array | Reversing elements using two pointers |
| Max/Min Element | Finding largest and smallest values |

## 💻 Programs Included

- `ArrayTraversal.java`
- `LinearSearch.java`
- `BinarySearch.java`
- `ReverseArray.java`
- `MaxElement.java`

*(More programs will be added as I progress.)*
